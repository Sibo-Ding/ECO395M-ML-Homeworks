## What causes what?

1.  Crime and police is a pair of simultaneity. More crime causes more
    police, but meanwhile more police causes less crime. Regressing
    crime on police cannot identify the causal effect of police on
    crime.

2.  They used terrorism alert level as an instrumental variable. On high
    terrorist alert days, there were more police neglecting the level of
    street crime.  
    Regression results: The total number of crimes in D.C. decreased by
    7.32 on a high alert day. Controlling for Metro ridership, the total
    number of crimes in D.C. decreased by 6.05 on a high alert day.

3.  They wanted to know whether the decrease in crime was caused by
    fewer victims on high alert days. Metro ridership captures the
    number of victims.

4.  
    crime = *β*<sub>0</sub> + *β*<sub>1</sub> × High Alert × District 1 + *β*<sub>2</sub> × High Alert × Other Districts + *β*<sub>3</sub> × log (midday ridership) + *u*
      
    In the first police district area (District 1 = 1), the total number
    of crimes decreased by 2.621 on high alert days (High Alert = 1). In
    other districts, the total number of crimes did not significantly
    change on high alert days.
