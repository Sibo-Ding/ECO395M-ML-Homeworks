## What causes what?

1.  Crime and police is a pair of simultaneity. More crime causes more
    police, but meanwhile more police causes less crime. Regressing
    crime on police cannot identify the causal effect of police on
    crime.

2.  They used terrorism alert level as an instrumental variable. On high
    alert days, there were more police neglecting the level of street
    crime.  
    Regression results: The total number of crimes in D.C. decreased by
    7.32 on a high alert day. Controlling for Metro ridership, the total
    number of crimes in D.C. decreased by 6.05 on a high alert day.

3.  They wanted to know whether the decrease in crime was caused by
    fewer victims on high alert days. Metro ridership captures the
    number of victims.
